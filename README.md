<!--Hi! My name is Rheymar Devera, and I'm a rising senior at the University of Maryland pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Science. I'm passionate about working with data and how we can shape and analyze it to create insights that solve real-world problems. At UMD, I have developed expertise in coding languages (Python, SQL, and R) to clean large datasets, create insightful visuals, and develop machine learning models to make impactful predictions, and I hope to use these skills to drive data-informed decisions that create meaningful change. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and apply data to make a measurable impact.-->
